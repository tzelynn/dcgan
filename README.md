# Experimenting with DCGAN

I attempted to train a DCGAN to generate images from 2 different datasets - [car damage](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lplenka/coco-car-damage-detection-dataset/) and [roadsign](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alincijov/road-traffic-signs-bounding-box-prediction). 

This was accomplished with limited success, with the models in both trainings facing mode collapse.
